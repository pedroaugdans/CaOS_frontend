Excluded from this indemnification are claims alleging that the Licensee's authorized use of unmodified Licensed Technology provided by the Licensor infringes any patent, trademark, or copyright. The Licensor reserves the right, at its option and sole discretion, to assume full control of the defense of such claims with legal counsel of its choice. The Licensee is not permitted to enter into any third-party agreement that would affect the Licensor's rights, constitute an admission of fault by the Licensor, or bind the Licensor in any manner, without the Licensor's prior written consent. The Licensee must promptly notify the Licensor in writing of any claims brought against the Licensor for which indemnification or defense is sought, thereby enabling the Licensor to manage legal strategies and potential settlements effectively. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor does not have any obligation to defend the Licensee or any End-User against such claim and therefore such defense shall be up to the Licensor’s sole discretion. If the Licensor decides to not defend a claim for infringement of Intellectual Property Rights, the Licensee may defend itself through counsel of its own choice and at its own expense.
